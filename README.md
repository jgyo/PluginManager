Until we can go through and update all of our images, you will see the old UI in our documentation, but the documentation will still be valid in most cases.

This old YouTube video instroduction should still help to get you up and running:

Or you can read our [Getting Started](https://github.com/jgyo/PluginManager/wiki/Getting-Started) page from our [Wiki.](https://github.com/jgyo/PluginManager/wiki)

## Road Map

1. Add a check for updates option.
2. Add a download or info link for zip file records.
3. Support for profiles.
4. Make 7zip files work.
5. Get plugin names fromn manifest.json files.
