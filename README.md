# Plugin Manager
The latest official release version of Plugin Manager is now [1.1.4.](https://github.com/jgyo/PluginManager/releases/tag/v.1.1.4) It contains a number of bug fixes plus a few new features.

One of the new features we want to highlight is its ability to check its version against what has been newly released. You can configure the program to check for new versions every time it starts in the Setup window, or have it check manually in the Help menu.

When a new version is available, you will see a response window like this:

From there, it is easy to open a browser to the download page for the newer version.

This YouTube link will give a brief demo of some of the program's features:
